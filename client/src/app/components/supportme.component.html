    <h1 class="display-4">Introducing Veracity</h1>
    <p class="lead">Your handy news analysis companion</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Disgruntled by the proliferation of biased news from untrustworthy sources, Veracity was built to give comsumers a handy tool to perform a quick analysis on new articles before hitting the send button which sends the article along with the analysis. 
        <br><br>
        The algorithm categorizes news content into 2 labels; real and notreal. Notreal would include satire, opinion pieces, fake news, and everything else that wasnâ€™t written in a purely factual way that also adhered to the AP standards. 
        <br><br>
        Future updates will allow users to make their own classifications like how one classifies spam mails today. <a href="https://www.ap.org/about/news-values-and-principles/" target="_blank">Learn more about AP values and princples here.</a>
